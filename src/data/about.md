# Intro

I am a physical therapist turned software engineer and recent graduate of Hack Reactor's 19-week full-stack software engineering immersive bootcamp. Though originally from eastern Pennsylvania, I'm currently living in San Francisco. I'm passionate about health, wellness, and social impact and am excited about the endless possibilities that software engineering can bring to those avenues.


# When not coding, I enjoy

- Hiking
- Meditation
- Long walks exploring San Francisco
- Puzzles of any kind
- Cycling
- Being near any large body of water
