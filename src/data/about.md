# Intro

I am a full-stack software engineer, currently working at a social health/ad tech company. My professional journey has been an intriguing blend of diverse experiences, having initially practiced as a physical therapist. This background instilled in me a profound respect for health and wellness, a value that continues to resonate in my current pursuit.

As a curious and driven person, I enjoy delving into the inner workings of complex systems, a trait that drew me naturally to software engineering. This innate passion for understanding and problem-solving fuels my enthusiasm for every project I take on.

My transition to software engineering is underpinned by a deep-seated commitment to driving positive change on a larger scale. I believe that technology holds the key to revolutionizing the realms of health, wellness, and social impact. This belief keeps me excited about the endless possibilities that software engineering brings to these fields.
