My professional journey has\r\n        been a blend of diverse experiences, as I was a physical therapist\r\n        prior to transitioning into software engineering. As a curious and driven person,\r\n        I enjoy delving into the inner workings of complex systems, a trait\r\n        that drew me naturally to software engineering. This innate passion\r\n        for understanding and problem-solving fuels my enthusiasm to continuously\r\n        learn and grow within the tech space.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p>\r\n        My transition to software engineering is underpinned by a deep-seated commitment\r\n        to driving positive change on a larger scale. I believe that technology holds the\r\n        key to revolutionizing the realms of health, wellness, and social impact. This\r\n        belief keeps me excited about the endless possibilities that software engineering\r\n        brings to these fields.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h1>When not coding, I enjoy</h1>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>hiking</li>\r\n        <li>meditation</li>\r\n        <li>long walks exploring San Francisco</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          puzzles of any kind (some favorites are Wordle/Octordle, jigsaw puzzles,\r\n          and Soduko)\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>cycling</li>\r\n        <li>being near large bodies of water</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          listening to podcasts (Hidden Brain, We Can Do Hard Things, The Heal\r\n          Podcast, Radiolab)\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h1>I dream of</h1>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>having  positive impact on the world.</li>\r\n        <li>being a better version of myself daily.</li>\r\n        <li>continuing my journey of lifelong learning.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </article>\r\n  </Main>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n"],"names":["title","description","className","id","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
